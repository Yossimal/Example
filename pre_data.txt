MYTHICAL MONSTERS***	Elder Eddas	The dragon, in place of being a creature evolved out of the imagination of Aryan man by the contemplation of lightning flashing through the caverns which he tenanted, as is held by some mythologists, is an animal which once lived and dragged its ponderous coils, and perhaps flew; which devastated herds, and on occasions swallowed their shepherd; which, establishing its lair in some cavern overlooking the fertile plain, spread terror and destruction around, and, protected from assault by dread or superstitious feeling, may even have been subsidised by the terror-stricken peasantry, who, failing the power to destroy it, may have preferred tethering offerings of cattle adjacent to its cavern to having it come down to seek supplies from amongst their midst.[1] To me the specific existence of the unicorn seems not incredible, and, in fact, more probable than that theory which assigns its origin to a lunar myth.[2] Again, believing as I do in the existence of some great undescribed inhabitant of the ocean depths, the much-derided sea-serpent, whose home seems especially to be adjacent to Norway, I recognise this monster as originating the myths of the midgard serpent which the Norse Elder Eddas have collected, this being the contrary view to that taken by mythologists, who invert the derivation, and suppose the stories current among the Norwegian fishermen to be modified versions of this important element of Norse mythology.[3] I must admit that, for my part, I doubt the general derivation of myths from "the contemplation of the visible workings of external nature.

CONFLICT OF RELIGIONS IN ROMAN EMPIRE ***	Interpretation of Dreams	 He refers to events of the year 104 or 105, and in his _Solon_ he speaks of Athens and Plato each having an unfinished masterpiece, so that he cannot have known of the intention of the Emperor Hadrian to finish the temple of Zeus Olympics.[50]  All that this need imply is that the _Solon_ was written before 125 A.D.  As to his death, it is certainly interesting when we recall how full of dreams and portents his Biographies are, to learn from Artemidorus' great work on the Interpretation of Dreams (written some forty years later) that Plutarch, when ill, dreamed that he was ascending to heaven, supported by Hermes.

THE BOOKLOVER AND HIS BOOKS ***	Flatland	It is not to be supposed that we shall prize all these books equally; some of them will never be more to us than great monuments which, for some reason peculiar to our temperaments, do not appeal to us; but among their number we shall find some that will throw open to our souls the very gates of heaven--books that will raise our natures forevermore to a higher power, as if from two-dimensional Flatland creatures we had suddenly been advanced to three dimensions, or, in our own humdrum world of length, breadth, and thickness, we had received the liberty of the mysterious fourth dimension.	True
THE GIANT OF THE NORTH ***	Flatland	Of course the men of Flatland kept their eyes fixed in wide amazement on Leo, as they paddled along, and this sudden laugh of his impressed them deeply, being apparently without a cause, coupled as it was with an air of absolute indifference to his probable fate, and to the presence of so many foes.	False
GLEANINGS BY THE WAY ***	Flatland	In one direction you see the blue waves of the outstretched ocean, upon which are visible all along the margin of the horizon, the whitened canvass of a hundred receding or approaching vessels; while in the intervening space, are seen the plains of Flatland and Flatbush, covered with grain, and verdure, and orchards, and forests, villages, hamlets, and farm-houses.	False
PUNCH ***	Great God Pan	None of his characters can ever _quite_ make out whether the latest noise is a mewing cat, the wind in the trees or the Great God Pan flirting with the Hamadryads.	True
THE COST ***	Great God Pan	"Let's  go out and watch the Great God Pan dedicate his brand-new temple."	False
IVORY APES AND PEACOCKS ***	Lord Jim	Consider the decomposition of the moral life of Lord Jim and its slow recrudescence; there is a prolonged duel between the will and the intelligence.	False
BLAZING THE WAY ***	Lord Jim	A further acquaintance with Lord Jim seemed to inspire the belief that the confidence of the writer was not misplaced.	True
A BOOK OF PREFACES ***	Lord Jim	Think of Captain MacWhirr reacting to social tradition, Lord Jim immersed in the class war, Lena Hermann seduced by the fashions, Almayer a candidate for office!	True
VICTORY ***	Lord Jim	A very subordinate personage in Lord Jim as far back as the year 1899, he became notably active in a certain short story of mine published in 1902.	True
SHAKESPEARE AND THE MODERN STAGE***	New Atlantis	The visitors to Bacon's imaginary island of New Atlantis saw statues erected at the public expense in memory of all who had won great distinction in the arts or sciences.	True
WRITINGS OF LORD MACAULAY ***	New Atlantis	The time would fail me if I attempted to do justice to the memory of all the illustrious men who, during that period, taught or learned wisdom within these ancient walls; geometricians, anatomists, jurists, philologists, metaphysicians, poets: Simpson and Hunter, Millar and Young, Reid and Stewart; Campbell, whose coffin was lately borne to a grave in that renowned transept which contains the dust of Chaucer, of Spenser, and of Dryden; Black, whose discoveries form an era in the history of chemical science; Adam Smith, the greatest of all the masters of political science; James Watt, who perhaps did more than any single man has done, since the New Atlantis of Bacon was written, to accomplish that glorious prophecy.	True
LIPPINCOTT'S MAGAZINE ***	New Atlantis	Thus does the New Atlantis provide for her republic, holding health to her children with one hand, and shaking from the other an infinity of toys and diversions; while for those of more thoughtful bent the sea turns without ceasing its ancient pages, written all over with inexhaustible romance.	True
RECONSTRUCTION IN PHILOSOPHY ***	New Atlantis	In view of the picture he draws in his New Atlantis of a State organized for collective inquiry, we readily forgive him his exaggerations.	True
THE IDEA OF PROGRESS ***	New Atlantis	The heads of Plato's city are metaphysicians, who regulate the welfare of the people by abstract doctrines established once for all; while the most important feature in the New Atlantis is the college of scientific investigators, who are always discovering new truths which may alter the conditions of life.	True
LETTERS OF EDWARD FITZGERALD***	New Atlantis	 This pathetic Ruin, still remaining by the Sea, would (I feel sure) have been more to one from the New Atlantis than all London can show: but I should have liked better had Mr. Lowell seen it on returning to America, rather than going to Spain, where the yet older and more splendid Moors would soon have effaced the memory of our poor Dunwich.	True
OUR LEGAL HERITAGE***	The Beggar's Opera	The Beggar's Opera depicting an immoral society unable to master its bandits was written by John Gay as a powerful attack on a government which most of London hated.	True
HOMES, HAUNTS OF EMINENT BRITISH POETS ***	The Beggar's Opera	From that time to the present, the effect has been, to a certain degree, the same, in a certain class; the songs of The Beggar's Opera have begun again to be sung, and a manifest tendency has been produced to exalt into this admiration of the multitude, highwaymen and women of the town.	True
A PORTRAIT OF OLD GEORGE TOWN ***	The Beggar's Opera	The Beggar's Opera for a time drove Italian Opera off the English stage (1728) by its caricature of Sir Robert Walpole, Prime Minister of George II.	True

HAZLITT ON ENGLISH LITERATURE ***	The Rape of the Lock	The Rape of the Lock is a double-refined essence of wit and fancy, as the Essay on Criticism is of wit and sense.	True
S. JOHNSON V1 ***	The Rape of the Lock	The Rape of the Lock was always regarded, by Pope, as the highest production of his genius.	True
LIVES OF THE POETS, VOL II ***	The Rape of the Lock	The Rape of the Lock stands forward, in the classes of literature, as the most exquisite example of ludicrous poetry.	True
VANITY FAIR ***	The Rape of the Lock	As he bowed over her he smiled, and quoted the hackneyed and beautiful lines from The Rape of the Lock about Belinda's diamonds, "which Jews might kiss and infidels adore."	True
LIVES OF THE POETS ***	The Rape of the Lock	It perhaps would be read with more applause, if The Rape of the Lock did not occur to the mind, and, by forcing a comparison, destroy all the satisfaction in perusing it; as the disproportion is so very considerable.	True
A MAN OF MEANS ***	King Solomon's Mines	When the interest became due, it would, as likely as not, be paid out of the capital just subscribed for the King Solomon's Mines Exploitation Association, the little deficiency in the latter being replaced in its turn, when absolutely necessary and not a moment before, by the transfer of some portion of the capital just raised for yet another company.	False
ADVENTURES AND LETTERS ***	King Solomon's Mines	All the fascination of King Solomon's Mines seems to be behind those great mountains and this I may add is a bit of advance work for mother, an entering wedge to my disappearing from sight for years and years in the Congo.	False
HUNTER QUATERMAIN'S STORY ***	King Solomon's Mines	At the request of Sir Henry and Captain Good I have written down a true and plain account of King Solomon's Mines and how we found them, so you will soon be able to learn all about that wonderful adventure for yourselves; but until then I will say nothing about it, not from any wish to disappoint your curiosity, or to make myself important, but simply because the whole story partakes so much of the marvellous, that I am afraid to tell it in a piecemeal, hasty fashion, for fear I should be set down as one of those common fellows of whom there are so many in my profession, who are not ashamed to narrate things they have not seen, and even to tell wonderful stories about wild animals they have never killed.	False
ETHNOLOGY OF THE BRITISH ISLANDS ***	The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle	The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle may illustrate this.	True
KING OLAF'S KINSMAN ***	The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle	The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle tells us how the earl was driven into sullen enmity with Ethelred by Streone's brother, and the Danish Sagas record Godwine's first introduction by Jarl Ulf to Cnut after the battle of Sherston.	True
PG WORKS OF O.W. HOLMES ***	The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle	The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says,--I quote it at second hand,--"So very straitly did he cause the survey to be made, that there was not a single hyde, nor a yardland of ground, nor--it is shameful to say what he thought no shame to do--was there an ox or a cow, or a pig passed by, and that was not down in the accounts, and then all these writings were brought to him."

TALES FROM DICKENS***	The Old Curiosity Shop	The Old Curiosity Shop belonged to the dwarf now and he at once moved into the parlor.	False
LITTLE RIVERS ***	The Old Curiosity Shop	Other streams played a part in the education of that happy boy: the Kaaterskill, where there had been nothing but the ghosts of trout for the last thirty years, but where the absence of fish was almost forgotten in the joy of a first introduction to Dickens, one very showery day, when dear old Ned Mason built a smoky fire in a cave below Haines's Falls, and, pulling The Old Curiosity Shop out of his pocket, read aloud about Little Nell until the tears ran down the cheeks of reader and listener--the smoke was so thick, you know: and the Neversink, which flows through John Burroughs's country, and past one house in particular, perched on a high bluff, where a very dreadful old woman come out and throws stones at "city fellers fishin' through her land" (as if any one wanted to touch her land!	True

SUSAN B. ANTHONY ***	Webster's Unabridged Dictionary	[53] There were also more substantial tokens, an Irish wool shawl from Mrs. Chant; a Webster's Unabridged Dictionary from Mrs. Colby, with the inscription, "The words in this volume can not express what women owe you;" a silk dress pattern from brother Daniel R.; a $50 check from sister Mary; $200 from Sarah Willis of Rochester, and $100 from the Woman's Political Equality Club of that city; seventy golden dollars from the Toledo Suffrage Club; $50 from Mrs. Arthur A. Mosher of St. Louis, and enough $5 bills in friendly letters to bring the amount to over $500.	True
HAWTHORNE AND HIS CIRCLE ***	Lays of Ancient Rome	We children had been drilled in Roman history, from Romulus to Caesar, and we could, and frequently did, repeat by heart the Lays of Ancient Rome by Macaulay, which were at that period better known, perhaps, than they are now.	True
BRIEF HANDBOOK OF ENGLISH AUTHORS ***	Lays of Ancient Rome	The impetuous rush and vigor of his Lays of Ancient Rome obscure their poetical defects.	True
THE HAUNTED BOOKSHOP ***	Lays of Ancient Rome	 The Lays of Ancient Rome and Austin Dobson to show her some good poetry.	True
GEORGE ELIOT; A CRITICAL STUDY OF HER LIFE, WRITINGS & PHILOSOPHY***	Middlemarch	Instead of Hayslope and Raveloe, Mrs. Poyser and Silas Marner, we have Middlemarch and Treby Magna, Dorothea Brooke and Felix Holt.	True
AUTHORS, BRITISH AND AMERICAN ***	Middlemarch	Middlemarch is considered by many critics her best work.	True
THE UNTROUBLED MIND ***	Middlemarch	II RELIGIO MEDICI At all events, it is certain that if any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having definite religious views, of being given to prayer and of otherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general presumption against his medical skill.	False
THE MIDDLE YEARS ***	Middlemarch	I find it idle even to wonder what "place" the author of Silas Marner and Middlemarch may be conceived to have in the pride of our literature--so settled and consecrated in the individual range of view is many such a case free at last to find itself, free after ups and downs, after fluctuations of fame or whatever, which have divested judgment of any relevance that isn't most of all the relevance of a living and recorded _relation_.	True
COMPLETE PG TWAIN ***	Middlemarch	I bored through Middlemarch during the past week, with its labored and tedious analyses of feelings and motives, its paltry and tiresome people, its unexciting and uninteresting story, and its frequent blinding flashes of single-sentence poetry, philosophy, wit, and what not, and nearly died from the overwork.	True

False
ABBEYCHURCH ***	Northanger Abbey	The later story was a rather hasty attempt to parody the modern sensation novel, as Northanger Abbey did the Radclyffe school, but it makes the mistake of having too real a mystery.	True
THE WORKS OF JANE AUSTEN ***	Northanger Abbey	The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine's feelings through the varieties of suspense, security, and disappointment; but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture, with Henry at her heart, and Northanger Abbey on her lips, she hurried home to write her letter.	True
MEMOIR OF JANE AUSTEN***	Northanger Abbey	 It was quite natural that Catherine Morland should have contrasted the magnificence of the offices at Northanger Abbey with the few shapeless pantries in her father's parsonage.	False
THE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS, VOL. I***	Northanger Abbey	*       *       *       *       * Northanger Abbey "Northanger Abbey" was written in 1798, revised for the press in 1803, and sold in the same year for £10 to a Bath bookseller, who held it in such light esteem that, after allowing it to remain for many years on his shelves, he was content to sell it back to the novelist's brother, Henry Austen, for the exact sum which he had paid for it at the beginning, not knowing that the writer was already the author of four popular novels.	True
FAME AND FORTUNE ***	Ragged Dick	Ragged Dick give him a stretcher once."	False
BEN, THE LUGGAGE BOY; ***	Ragged Dick	In presenting "Ben, the Luggage Boy," to the public, as the fifth of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history; the particulars of the story having been communicated to him, by Ben himself, nearly two years since.	True
OVER THE PLUM PUDDING ***	Ragged Dick	Even those honest little critics the boys and girls were finding more to delight them in the doings of Richard Coeur de Lion and Alice in Wonderland than in the more remarkable and intensely American adventures of Ragged Dick or Mickie the Motorboy.	True
THE ART OF THE MOVING PICTURE***	The Black Cat	Edgar Poe, always a magician, blends this power with the prophetical note in the poem, The Haunted Palace, and in the stories of William Wilson, The Black Cat and The Tell-tale Heart.	True
THE JOURNALS OF LEWIS AND CLARK ***	The Black Cat	[Clark, October 28, 1804] Sunday 28th of October 1804 a windey Day, fair and Clear many of the Grosvantres (or Big Bellies) and Watersons Came to See us and hear the Council the wind being So violently hard from the S.

PROMENADES OF AN IMPRESSIONIST ***	The Black Cat	The plate of The Black Cat piles horror on horror's head (literally, for the demon cat perches on the head of the corpse) and is, all said, pictorial melodrama.	False
TRANSLATIONS FROM THE GERMAN ***	The Hypocrite	[Note 4: The Hypocrite does not imitate the old practice, of cutting fruit by a knife poisoned only on the one side, and giving the poisoned side to the victim, the cutter eating the sound side himself; on the contrary, he so disinterestedly inverts this practice, that to others he shows and gives the sound moral half, or side, and retains for himself the poisoned one.

THE LIFE OF LORD BYRON***	Childe Harold's Pilgrimage	Childe Harold's Pilgrimage is the most faithful descriptive poem which has been written since the Odyssey; and the occasional scenes introduced into the other poems, when the action is laid in Greece, are equally vivid and glowing.	True
THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE ***	Childe Harold's Pilgrimage	Of this tour he composed a poetical journal Childe Harold's Pilgrimage in which he ascribed his experiences and reflections not to himself but to a fictitious character Childe Harold described as a melancholy young nobleman prematurely familiar with evil sated with pleasures and embittered against humanity.	True
FREETHINKERS ***	Childe Harold's Pilgrimage	He then travelled on the Continent, the result of which was seen in his Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and other works.	True
HOME LIGHTS AND SHADOWS ***	Childe Harold's Pilgrimage	Many portions of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are not surpassed for grandeur, beauty, and force, in the English language: and the Alastor of Shelly, is full of passages of exquisite tenderness and almost unequalled finish of versification.	True
BLACKWOOD'S EDINBURGH ***	Childe Harold's Pilgrimage	Childe Harold's Pilgrimage undertakes an Idea--that of a proud spirit, born in a castle, self-driven from the bosom of home, seeking refuge, solace, renovation, from Nature, of sensibilities worn out with enjoyment.	True
CAVALRY IN FUTURE WARS ***	The Art of War	The Art of War has undergone a momentous change; indeed, it has been revolutionized since the Franco-German War.	False

ARTS AND CRAFTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES***	Salomé	In the panel where Salomé is portrayed as dancing, a grave little monkey is seen watching her from under the table.	False
OSCAR WILDE ***	Salomé	Salomé kissing the pale lips of Iokanaan may once have moved him when he saw her behind the ghostly footlights of that secret theatre in which each man is his own dramatist, his own stage-manager, and his own audience.	False
OSCAR WILDE ***	Salomé	If there is a fault to be found with the character it is that Bernhardt not Salomé is depicted, and yet who shall say that there is much difference between the temperaments or the physique of the two women.	False
THE OUTRAGE ***	Salomé	The next number on the program was a dance; a somewhat modified Salomé dance, performed by Miss Price.	False
IVORY APES AND PEACOCKS ***	Salomé	I don't know which to admire the most, the Hamlet or the Lohengrin, the Salomé or the Persée et Andromède.	False

KING OF CAMARGUE ***	Salomé	In 1448, King René, being then at Aix, his capital, heard a preacher declare that Saintes Marie-Jacobé and Salomé were certainly buried beneath the church of Villa-de-la-Mar. René at once consulted his confessor, Père Adhémar, and sent a messenger to the Pope, asking that he be authorized to make search underground in the church.	False
UNICORNS ***	Salomé	His Dorian Grey, apart from the inversion element, is poor Huysmans's--just look into that masterpiece, A Rebours; not to mention Poe's tale, The Oval Portrait; while Salomé is Flaubert in operetta form--his gorgeous Herodias watered down for uncritical public consumption.	True
HEATH'S MOD. LANG. SER.: MARIUCHA ***	Salomé	The purest romanticism reigns in the play, as Martinenche has pointed out; José León and Salomé are not other than less poetic versions of Hernani and Doña Sol.	True
INTERPRETERS ***	Salomé	For instance, on one occasion she astonished even Oscar Hammerstein by replacing Lina Cavalieri as Salomé in _Hérodiade_, a rôle she had not previously sung for five years, at an hour's notice on the evening of an afternoon on which she had appeared as Elektra.	False
CYNTHIA'S CHAUFFEUR***	Salomé	Didn't you see me do the Salomé act when you were thrown on the screen?"	True
SANTO DOMINGO ***	Salomé	The civil wars have inspired many pathetic compositions, and poems like Salomé Ureña's apostrophe to the ruins of colonial times, Bienvenido S. Nouel's elegy on the ruins left by the late revolutions, and Enrique Henriquez' "Miserere!", gems of verse, are veritable cries of anguish at the desolation wrought by fratricidal strife.	True
ANATOLE FRANCE ***	Salomé	The shop-front presented an attractive appearance: there were Flemish angels in green copes, after the manner of Gérard David, a Salomé of the Luini school, a Saint Barbara in painted wood of French workmanship, Limoges enamel-work, Bohemian and Venetian glass, dishes from Urbino.

THE SOUL OF SUSAN YELLAM***	St. Martin's Summer	You may think of this time as the St. Martin's Summer of Mrs. Yellam's life.	False
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, COMPLETE ***	St. Martin's Summer	 The natives, who under the weakness of his former rule had been discontented and troublesome, now settled down submissively to their yoke; the Spaniards began to work in earnest on their farms; and there descended upon island affairs a brief St. Martin's Summer of peace before the final winter of blight and death set in.	False
RAGNA***	St. Martin's Summer	She realized that afternoon is the time to see Venice, the strong light of morning throws into intolerable relief the decay of the city; the St. Martin's Summer of the glorious Republic requires the mellow haze of the hours before sunset, as a fading beauty is best seen by candle light, and often in the afternoon, she would slip away to some old church, and in solitary musing to steep herself in the wonderful atmosphere of golden autumn.	False
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI, VOL. 156, FEB. 26, 1919***	St. Martin's Summer	Here, soaring high above the cenotaph in which the roses and rapture of our youth lie entombed in one red burial blent, we see the shimmering strands of St. Martin's Summer drawn athwart the happenless days of Autumn, with the dewdrops of cosmic unction sparkling in the rays of a sunshine never yet seen on land or sea, but reflecting as in a magic mirror that far off El Dorado, that land where Summer always is "i-cumen in," for which each and all of us feel a perpetual nostalgia.	False
HERBAL SIMPLES APPROVED FOR MODERN USES OF CURE***	The Scarlet Pimpernel	The Scarlet Pimpernel is named _Anagallis_, from the Greek _anagelao_, to laugh; either because, as Pliny says, the plant removes obstructions of the liver, and spleen, which would engender sadness, or because of the graceful beauty of its flowers:-- "No ear hath heard, no tongue can tell The virtues of the Pimpernell."	False
THE LAUGHING CAVALIER ***	The Scarlet Pimpernel	For the past eight years now--ever since the true story of The Scarlet Pimpernel was put on record by the present author--these gentle, kind, inquisitive friends have asked me to trace their descent back to an ancestor more remote than was Sir Percy, to one in fact who by his life and by his deeds stands forth from out the distant past as a conclusive proof that the laws which govern the principles of heredity are as unalterable as those that rule the destinies of the universe.	True
THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET ***	The Scarlet Pimpernel	The Scarlet Pimpernel they call him!	True
I WILL REPAY ***	The Scarlet Pimpernel	"And now let me tell you, friend, that my League of The Scarlet Pimpernel never attempted the impossible, and to try and drag the Queen out of the clutches of these murderous rascals now, is attempting the unattainable."	False
LORD TONY'S WIFE ***	The Scarlet Pimpernel	The Scarlet Pimpernel was in Nantes--that fact was established beyond a doubt--but Chauvelin had come to the conclusion that so far as Yvonne Dewhurst herself was concerned, she knew nothing of the mysterious agencies that were working on her behalf.	False
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF THE CELTIC RACE***	Tristan and Iseult	But this delicacy of Dermot's is not at all to Crania's mind, and she conveys her wishes to him in a manner which is curiously paralleled by an episode in the tale of Tristan and Iseult of Brittany, as told by Heinrich von Freiberg.	True
THE ROMANCE OF TRISTAN AND ISEULT ***	Tristan and Iseult	On the day chosen for the meeting, the field shone far with the rich tents of the barons, and suddenly Tristan and Iseult came out at the forests edge, and caught sight of King Mark far off among his Barony: Friend, said Tristan, there is the King, your lordhis knights and his men; they are coming towards us, and very soon we may not speak to each other again.	False
LEAVES IN THE WIND ***	Tristan and Iseult	You may wander all day in the beech woods and never catch a glimpse of Tristan and Iseult coming down the glades or hear an echo of Robin Hood's horn; but walk in the beech woods by moonlight and every shadow will have its mystery and will talk to you of the legends of long ago.	True
THE UNITY OF CIVILIZATION***	Tristan and Iseult	We have only to read the earliest and greatest forms in which the story of Tristan and Iseult have come down to us to see this for ourselves.	True
THE WORLD'S GREAT MEN OF MUSIC ***	Tristan and Iseult	The characters of Tristan and Iseult are primarily taken from a French legend.	True

THE WAYS OF MEN***	Daisy Miller	In London or Rome she may be presented in a few international salons, but as she finds it difficult to make her new acquaintances understand what an exalted position she occupies at home, the chances are that pique at seeing some Daisy Miller attract all the attention will drive my lady back to the city where she is known and appreciated, nothing being more difficult for an American âswellâ than explaining to the uninitiated in what way her position differs from that of the rest of her compatriots.

HARPER'S NEW MONTHLY, OCTOBER 1851 ***	Moby Dick	But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red woolen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him.	False
GREAT SEA STORIES ***	Moby Dick	And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.	False
MUTUAL AID ***	The Descent of Man	In The Descent of Man he gave some powerful pages to illustrate its proper, wide sense.	True
HALLECK'S NEW ENGLISH LITERATURE ***	Volpone	Volpone says:-- "Good morning to the day; and next, my gold!-- Open the shrine, that I may see my saint.	False
ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA ***	Volpone	Still, Captain Bobadil and Captain Tucca, Macilente and Fungoso, Volpone and Mosca, and a goodly number of other characters impress themselves permanently upon the memory of those whose attention they have as a matter of course commanded.	True
A STUDY OF SHAKESPEARE***	Volpone	 The resemblance of this character to that of Volpone in _The Fox_ and to that of Face in _	True
SHAKESPEARE, BEN JONSON, BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER***	Volpone	If it were possible to lessen the paramountcy of Volpone himself, a most delightful comedy might be produced, by making Celia the ward or niece of Corvino, instead of his wife, and Bonario her lover.	True
18TH CENTURY IN ENGLISH CARICATURE ***	Volpone	I have been fortunate enough to obtain for this work reproductions of three among the best ones; but my account may do well to commence with that delightful print (another hit at Charles James Fox) of the "Introduction of Citizen Volpone and his Suite at Paris"; might note further "The Vexation of Little Boney"; and strike a higher note in "The Handwriting upon the Wall," where, in the hour of his triumph, Buonaparte, seated at table beside an enormously stout Josephine, with gigantic and savage-looking Guards and very _décolletées_ and ringleted maids-of-honour waiting in service on them, sees with dilated eyes on the wall the warning of his doom.	True
THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY ***	Volpone	Many men to fetch over a young woman, widows, or whom they love, will not stick to crack, forge and feign any thing comes next, bid his boy fetch his cloak, rapier, gloves, jewels, &c. in such a chest, scarlet-golden-tissue breeches, &c. when there is no such matter; or make any scruple to give out, as he did in Petronius, that he was master of a ship, kept so many servants, and to personate their part the better take upon them to be gentlemen of good houses, well descended and allied, hire apparel at brokers, some scavenger or prick-louse tailors to attend upon them for the time, swear they have great possessions, [5178]bribe, lie, cog, and foist how dearly they love, how bravely they will maintain her, like any lady, countess, duchess, or queen; they shall have gowns, tiers, jewels, coaches, and caroches, choice diet, "The heads of parrots, tongues of nightingales, The brains of peacocks, and of ostriches, Their bath shall be the juice of gilliflowers, Spirit of roses and of violets, The milk of unicorns," &c. as old Volpone courted Celia in the [5179]comedy, when as they are no such men, not worth a groat, but mere sharkers, to make a fortune, to get their desire, or else pretend love to spend their idle hours, to be more welcome, and for better entertainment.	True
CAPTAIN DANGEROUS, VOL. 2 OF 3 ***	Volpone	Sir Basil Hopwood was the rather of the same complexion of Entrails with that Signor Volpone whom we have all seen--at least such of us as be old Boys--in Ben Jonson's play of the _Fox_.	True
ENCYC. BRITANNICA, VOL 8 SL 6 ***	Volpone	Much is gained by a significant introduction of hero or heroine--thus Antigone is dragged in by the watchman, Gloucester enters alone upon the scene, Volpone is discovered in adoration of his golden saint.	True
TIME CRIME ***	Our Mutual Friend	"What does Our Mutual Friend think about all this?" he asked, gesturing toward the screen.	False
DICKENS AS AN EDUCATOR***	Our Mutual Friend	The depressing influence of another form of coercion is shown in Our Mutual Friend by the effect of Mr. Podsnap's character on his daughter Georgiana.	True
TENNYSON AND HIS FRIENDS ***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	"Sometimes I think Shakespeare's Sonnets finer than his Plays--which is of course absurd.	True
IN A GREEN SHADE ***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	Shakespeare's Sonnets offer a more doubtful field of experiment.	True
AVRIL ***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	These "Sonnets for Hélène" should be common knowledge: they are (with Du Bellay's) the evident original upon which the author of Shakespeare's Sonnets modelled his work: they are the late and careful effort of Ronsard's somewhat spendthrift genius.	True
THE BROWNING CYCLOPÃDIA ***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	If we accept Shakespeare's Sonnets in their natural sense, as the best authorities say we must, they open up to the public gaze passages in the life of the great poet which those who love an ideal Shakespeare would rather have not known.	True
YOUNG LIVES ***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	Together they had read Keats for the first wonderful time; together learned Shakespeare's Sonnets by heart; together rolled out over tavern-tables the sumptuous cadences of De Quincey.	True
THE LIFE OF FROUDE ***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	However, he admitted Skelton's article on the other side, and added, with magnificent candour, that "to this generation Browning's poetry is as uninteresting as Shakespeare's Sonnets were to the last century."	True
EXPOSITOR'S BIBLE: ECCLESIASTES ***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	And there is hardly a finer passage in Shakespeare's Sonnets than that (CXVI.) in which he sings the disinterestedness of Love, and its superiority to all change: "Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove.	True
REVIEWS***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	 Far be it from us to make any heartless allusion to the fact that Shakespeare's Sonnets were brought out at fivepence, or that for fourpence-halfpenny one could have bought a Martial in ancient Rome.	True
LETTERS OF EDWARD FITZGERALD***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	So by Shakespeare's Sonnets roasted, and Wordsworth's poems basted, My heart will be well toasted, and excellently tasted.	True
THE BODLEIAN AND OTHERS ***	Shakespeare's Sonnets	He secured Shakespeare's Sonnets (1609) and the first edition of the _Rape of Lucrece_ for two guineas, and accounted half a crown a fair average price for quarto copies of Elizabethan plays.	True
CHARMIDES ***	Theaetetus	It is true that a few of the dialogues, such as the Republic and the Timaeus, or the Theaetetus and the Sophist, or the Meno and the Apology, contain allusions to one another.	True
THEAETETUS ***	Theaetetus	Had we no other indications, we should be disposed to range the Theaetetus with the Apology and the Phaedrus, and perhaps even with the Protagoras and the Laches.	True
CHRISTIANITY AND GREEK PHILOSOPHY ***	Theaetetus	Theaetetus essays a variety of answers, such as, "Science is sensation," "Science is right judgment or opinion," "Science is right opinion with logical definition."	True
PHILEBUS ***	Theaetetus	Of the Heracliteans, whom he is said by Aristotle to have cultivated in his youth, he speaks in the Philebus, as in the Theaetetus and Cratylus, with irony and contempt.	True
PLATO, COMPANIONS OF SOKRATES, VOL I ***	Theaetetus	The Theaetetus and the Parmenides, two of the most negative among the Platonic dialogues, seem to connect themselves, by the _personnel_ of the drama, with the Megaric philosophers: the former dialogue is ushered in by Eukleides, and is, as it were, dedicated to him: the latter dialogue exhibits, as its _protagonistes_, the veteran Parmenides himself, who forms the one factor of the Megaric philosophy, while Sokrates forms the other.	True
PLATO, COMPANIONS OF SOKRATES, VOL IV ***	Theaetetus	This passage deserves notice, inasmuch as Plato here affirms, in very plain language, the Protagorean doctrine, which we have seen him trying to refute in the Theaetetus and Kratylus,--"Homo Mensura,--Every man is a measure to himself.	True
HISTORY OF FREE THOUGHT IN REFERENCE TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION***	Theaetetus	(1) it was viewed as a fact of mind, an innate conception of forms (e.g. in Meno); (2) as useful in guiding perplexed minds to truth, and sifting philosophical doctrines by means of the dialectical process, e.g. in the Theaetetus and Parmenides; (3) as representing an objective reality, a true cause in nature external to the mind, as well as an hypothesis in science (e.g. in the Republic); (4) as having a mystical connexion with divinity, and furnishing a cosmogony, Whether this passage, from the subjective conception to the objective reality, be really or only logically the order of development in Plato's ideal theory, it is clear that the growth of Schleiermacher's mind admits of comparison with this supposed order of development in Plato; though there is a slight variation in the steps of the process.	True
THE ECLIPSE OF FAITH ***	Theaetetus	As it turns out, Socrates, appears to be at least equally ignorant with Theaetetus as to the definition of which he is in search.	True
A REVIEW OF THE SYSTEMS OF ***	Theaetetus	The passage from the Theaetetus above quoted shows us the unhappy and subservient position of Athenian women in one respect; and many other passages of Plato throw an unfavorable light upon their lot; though we have, perhaps, to remember that the central figure of the Dialogues had some personal reason for being a woman-hater.	True
INTRODUCTION TO THE ***	Theaetetus	Plato also clearly teaches us that our apostacy from better natures is only to be healed by a flight from hence, when he defines in his Theaetetus philosophy to be a flight from terrestrial evils: for he evinces by this that passions are connascent with mortals alone.	True
PROTAGORAS ***	Theaetetus	It may be remarked that Protagoras is consistently presented to us throughout as the teacher of moral and political virtue; there is no allusion to the theories of sensation which are attributed to him in the Theaetetus and elsewhere, or to his denial of the existence of the gods in a well-known fragment ascribed to him; he is the religious rather than the irreligious teacher in this Dialogue.	True
PHAEDO ***	Theaetetus	The Theaetetus also describes, in a digression, the desire of the soul to fly away and be with God--'and to fly to him is to be like him.'	True
STATESMAN ***	Theaetetus	The Stranger suggests that Theaetetus shall be allowed to rest, and that Socrates the younger shall respond in his place; Theodorus agrees to the suggestion, and Socrates remarks that the name of the one and the face of the other give him a right to claim relationship with both of them.	False
THE LEGACY OF GREECE ***	Theaetetus	Theaetetus died young, but we know enough of him to feel sure that he was one of the few great original mathematicians who have appeared in history.	False
MENO ***	Theaetetus	The difficulty in framing general notions which has appeared in this and in all the previous Dialogues recurs in the Gorgias and Theaetetus as well as in the Republic.	True
THE MOGHUL ***	The Antichrist	The Antichrist himself could not have made our cup more bitter, could not have given us a greater test of our Christian love.	False
VISIONARIES ***	The Antichrist	The Antichrist has been predicted for the past thousand years.	False
GARGANTUA AND PANTAGRUEL, ***	The Antichrist	 The Antichrist is already born; at least it is so reported by many.	False
THE DYNASTS ***	The Antichrist	A puppet I, by force inflexible, Was bid to wed Napoleon at a nod,-- The man acclaimed to me from cradle-days As the incarnate of all evil things, The Antichrist himself.--I kissed the cup, Gulped down the inevitable, and married him; But none the less I saw myself therein The lamb whose innocent flesh was dressed to grace The altar of dynastic ritual!-- Hence Elba flung no duty-call to me, Neither does Paris now.	False
SINISTER STREET, VOL. 2 ***	The Merchant of Venice	The performance of The Merchant of Venice took place and was a great success.	True
CHRISTIANITY AND PROGRESS ***	The Merchant of Venice	 So an authority in literature does not say to his students: The Merchant of Venice is a great drama; you may accept my judgment on that--I know.	True
WORKS OF SAMUEL JOHNSON V. 5 ***	The Merchant of Venice	Of The Merchant of Venice the style is even and easy, with few peculiarities of diction, or anomalies of construction.	True
SAY AND SEAL, VOLUME II ***	The Merchant of Venice	The Merchant of Venice was not the only play enacting that evening; and the temptation to break in upon the one, made the doctor, as often as he could, break off the other; though the interest of the plot for a while gave him little chance.	True
REVIEWS***	The Merchant of Venice	 However, there are many people, no doubt, who find a great source of interest in the fact that  he author of The Merchant of Venice once brought an action for the sum of 1 pound, 15s. 10d.	True
A MOTHER'S LIST OF BOOKS FOR ***	The Merchant of Venice	The plot of The Merchant of Venice is composed of two distinct stories: that of the bond, and that of the caskets.	True

SHORT STORIES OLD AND NEW ***	Aesop's Fables	From Aesop's Fables to Kipling's Jungle Books literature is full of animal stories.	True
THE PG ENCYCLOPEDIA, VOL 1 ***	Aesop's Fables	 The collections which we possess under the name of Aesop's Fables are late renderings of Babrius's Version or Progumnasmata, rhetorical exercises of varying age and merit.	True
PG WORKS OF O.W. HOLMES ***	Aesop's Fables	If there are any among my readers who loved Aesop's Fables chiefly on account of the Moral appended, they will perhaps be pleased to turn backward and learn what I have to say here.	True

BIG DUMMY'S GUIDE TO THE INTERNET ***	Aesop's Fables	Begun in 1971, the project already maintains a "library" of hundreds of books and stories, from Aesop's Fables to "Through the Looking Glass" available for the taking.	True
THE NEGRO PROBLEM ***	Aesop's Fables	I have heard by the hour some ordinary old uneducated Negro tell those inimitable animal stories, brought to literary existence in "Uncle Remus," with such quaint humor, delicious conceit and masterly delineation of plot, character and incident that nothing but the conventional rating of Aesop's Fables could put them in the same class.	True
THE GRATEFUL INDIAN ***	Aesop's Fables	 It was the same Janie who, at seven years old, devoured books of geography and history, but laid down Aesop's Fables in disgust, unable to detect truth embedded in fiction.	True
A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE INTERNET ***	Aesop's Fables	 Ridicule Those who would prefer to think their worlds would be destroyed by infinite availability of books such as: Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Aesop's Fables or the Complete Works of Shakespeare, Milton or others, have ridiculed the efforts of those who would give them to all free of charge by arguing about whether it should be:  "To be or not to be" or "To be [,] or not to be" or  "To be [;] or not to be"/"To be	True
PROBLEMS OF IMMANENCE ***	Aesop's Fables	 No doubt, our incurable habit of reading the facts of our own moral nature into the actions of beasts and birds accounts for the vogue alike of Aesop's Fables and of such works as the _Jungle Books_; but what strikes us as cruelty in the tiger is not a moral quality at all, any more than it is a motive of heroism that impels the mongoose to fight cobras.	True

PUNCH'S HISTORY OF THE WAR ***	Great Expectations	Great Expectations and their Tardy Fulfilment, thus in headline fashion might one summarise the story of 1919, with Peace, the world's desire, waiting for months outside the door of the Conference Chamber, with civil war in Germany, Berlin bombed by German airmen, and anarchy in Russia, and here at home impatience and discomfort, aggravated in the earlier months by strikes and influenza, the largely increased numbers of unemployed politicians, the weariest and dreariest of winter weather.

TALES FROM DICKENS***	Great Expectations	But his Great Expectations taught him bad habits.	False
WITH WORLD'S GREATEST TRAVELLERS, VOL 3 ***	House of the Seven Gables	The House of the Seven Gables is a succession of Rembrandt pictures, done in words instead of oils.	True
THE ART OF THE MOVING PICTURE***	House of the Seven Gables	The author-producer-photographer, or one or all three, will make into a personality some place akin to the House of the Seven Gables till the ancient building dominates the fancy as it does in Hawthorne's tale.	True
HAWTHORNE ***	House of the Seven Gables	As it is, the mustiness and mouldiness of the tenants of the House of the Seven Gables crumble away rather too easily.	False

SINISTER STREET, VOL. 1 ***	Boswell's Life of Johnson	"Then cure yourself of that most lamentable and most démodé taste, or I shall presently believe that you read a page or two of Boswell's Life of Johnson every morning, while the water is running into your bath.	True
THE BAPTIST MAGAZINE, VOL. ***	Boswell's Life of Johnson	The notices of this feeling in Boswell's Life of Johnson are very interesting; but with all literary men our poet was not in harmony, for so much rancour was manifested between Smart and Sir John Hill, that the former began a work entitled _Hilliad_, and the latter was equally pugnacious in a periodical, entitled _Smartiad_.	True
PG WORKS OF O.W. HOLMES ***	Boswell's Life of Johnson	The charm of Boswell's Life of Johnson is that it not merely records his admirable conversation, but also gives us many of those lesser peculiarities which are as necessary to a true biography as lights and shades to a portrait on canvas.	True
WRITINGS OF LORD MACAULAY ***	Boswell's Life of Johnson	Suppose that the copyright of Boswell's Life of Johnson had belonged, as it well might, during sixty years, to Boswell's eldest son.	True

THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY  ***	Boswell's Life of Johnson	Pepys tells us more than Hume about the court of Charles II., and Boswell's Life of Johnson is the best biography in the language,--but he must be a shabby fellow who would be either a Boswell or a Pepys.	True

THE AMERICANIZATION OF EDWARD BOK ***	Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde	When the stories of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Little Lord Fauntleroy were made into plays, Bok was given an opportunity for an entirely different kind of publicity.	True
THE COW PUNCHER ***	Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde	 It seemed the community had two natures; a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde on a community basis.	True
EVENING ROUND UP***	Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde	This nice man was the floor man for a big grain commission house; he read the message, and then did the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde act.	True

INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY, MAY 1851 ***	The Scarlet Letter	Like most of his shorter stories, The Scarlet Letter finds its scene and time with the earlier Puritans.	True
THE PG ENCYCLOPEDIA, VOL 1 ***	The Scarlet Letter	 He, like Longfellow, embodied the national tradition, in this case the Puritan past; but he seized the subject, not in its historical aspects and diversity of character and event, but psychologically in its moral passion in The Scarlet Letter (1850), and less abstractly, more picturesquely, more humanly, in its blood tradition, in The House of the Seven Gables.	True
HAWTHORNE AND HIS CIRCLE ***	The Scarlet Letter	The Scarlet Letter, upon coming to close quarters with it, turned out to be not a story of such moderate caliber as Hawthorne had hitherto been used to write, but an affair likely to extend over two or three hundred pages, which, instead of a month or so, might not be completed in a year; yet it was too late to substitute something more manageable for it--in the first place, because nothing else happened to be at his disposal, and secondly, because The Scarlet Letter took such intimate hold upon the vitals of his heart and mind that he was by no means able to free himself from it until all had been fulfilled.	True
PASSAGES ***	The Scarlet Letter	Speaking of Thackeray, I cannot but wonder at his coolness in respect to his own pathos, and compare it with my emotions, when I read the last scene of The Scarlet Letter to my wife, just after writing it,--tried to read it rather, for my voice swelled and heaved, as if I were tossed up and down on an ocean as it subsides after a storm.	True
A SMALL BOY AND OTHERS ***	The Scarlet Letter	The Scarlet Letter and The Seven Gables had the deep tone as much as one would; but of the current efforts of the imagination they were alone in having it till Walt Whitman broke out in the later fifties--and I was to know nothing of that happy genius till long after.	True

ATLANTIC MONTHLY, VOLUME 7, ISSUE 42, APRIL, 1861***	Kalevala	The hand of the daughter of the mistress of Pohjola is what, each and all, the three sons of Kalevala strive to win,--a hand which the mother of the owner will give to any one who can make for her and for Pohjola _Sampo_, Wainamoinen will not; but he knows of one who will,--Illmarinen.	False
CUSTOM AND MYTH ***	Kalevala	The Kalevala is thus a link between _MÃ¤rchen_ and _Volkslieder_ on one side, and epic poetry on the other. '	True
THE BOOK OF THE EPIC***	Kalevala	The Kalevala attracted immediate attention and has already been translated into most modern languages.	True
MAN, PAST AND PRESENT ***	Kalevala	"There seems to be no doubt that some parts date back to at least 3000 years ago, before the Finns and the Hungarians had become distinct peoples; for the names of the divinities, many of the customs, and even particular incantations and bits of superstitions mentioned in the Kalevala are curiously duplicated in ancient Hungarian writings."	True
RUSSIA: ITS PEOPLE AND ITS LITERATURE***	Kalevala	Perhaps these _bilinas_ and the Finnish Kalevala are the only primitive epics in which the laborer plays a first part and puts the fighting hero into the shade.	True
HINDUISM AND BUDDHISM ***	Kalevala	Thus the Kalevala relates how WÃ¤inÃ¤mÃ¶inen was building a boat by means of songs when the process came to a sudden stop because he had forgotten three words.	True
BOOKS AND HABITS ***	Kalevala	You have seen that merely as a collection of wonderful stories the Kalevala is of extraordinary interest, that it is also of interest as describing the social ethics of a little known people--finally that it is of interest, of very remarkable interest, merely as natural poetry--poetry treating of wild nature, especially rivers and forests and mountains, of the life of the fisher and hunter and wood-cutter.	True
THE LILAC FAIRY BOOK ***	Kalevala	He had never read Kalevala and knew nothing of the sea gods of old, but the students proceeded to explain to him.[2]	True

FINNISH LEGENDS ***	Kalevala	In these stories Mr. T. M. Crawford's metrical translation of the Kalevala has been quite closely followed, even to the adoption of his Anglicised, or rather Anglo-Swedish, forms for proper names, though in some instances the original Finnish form has been reverted to.	True
IVORY APES AND PEACOCKS ***	The Idiot	The Possessed, that extraordinary study of souls obsessed by madness and crime, The Brothers Karamazov, The House of the Dead, and The Idiot are to-day in the hands of American readers who indorse what Nietzsche said of the Russian master: "This profound man ... has perceived that Siberian convicts, with whom he lived for a long time (capital criminals for whom there was no return to society), were persons carved out of the best, the hardest and the most valuable material to be found in the Russian dominions....	True
HALF-HOURS WITH THE IDIOT ***	The Idiot	The Idiot blushed.	False
VELAZQUEZ ***	The Idiot	 The Idiot of Coria is also dressed in green, though his garments are a little richer, but Don Antonio seems to have been a person of some importance.	False

OLDPORT DAYS ***	Madame Bovary	A mob of miners or of New York bullies may be uncomfortable neighbors, and may make a man of refinement hesitate whether to stop his ears or to feel for his revolver; but they hold more promise for the coming generations than the line which ends in Madame Bovary or the Vicomte de Camors.	True
THE LONDON VENTURE ***	Madame Bovary	Imagine then, sitting by a window of a large house in the _Rue Colbert_, a young girl with a battered copy of Madame Bovary skilfully hidden beside her, and a little erect old man, very stiff but _soigné_, and cruelly aged by the sunlight which poured blessedly into the room, standing by the arm of her chair, asking her to marry him.	True
IVORY APES AND PEACOCKS ***	Madame Bovary	When Flaubert wrote Madame Bovary his admirers demanded a replica and were disappointed with Salammbô, with Sentimental Education, above all, with The Temptation of St. Anthony and Bouvard and Pécuchet.	True
UNICORNS ***	Madame Bovary	Hailed as chief of the realists, the author of Madame Bovary took an ironic delight in publishing Salammbô, which was romantic enough to please that prince of romanticists, Victor Hugo.	True
PSYCHOTHERAPY ***	Madame Bovary	When he was writing the scene in which he describes the effects of the arsenic which Madame Bovary takes, he himself suffered from practically all the symptoms due to the drug.	True
MISCELLANIES***	Madame Bovary	The chief merit of Madame Bovary is not the moral lesson that can be found in it, any more than the chief merit of Salammbo is its archaeology; but Flaubert was perfectly right in exposing the ignorance of those who called the one immoral and the other inaccurate; and not merely was he right in the ordinary sense of the word, but he was artistically right, which is everything.	True
A NOVELIST ON NOVELS ***	Madame Bovary	Need I say more than that _Madame Bovary_, the greatest novel the world has seen, is now being sold in a shilling paper edition under a cover which shows Madame Bovary in a sort of private dining-room, dressed in a chemise, and preparing to drink off a bumper of champagne.	True
THE PUBLIC DOMAIN***	Madame Bovary	If people need Madame Bovary or The New York Times or a new kind of antibiotic, surely the market will provide it?	True
VIE DE BOHÃME ***	Madame Bovary	It is a novel in which the author has with the highest exercise of penetrative imagination treated what Mr. Henry James would call the "germ"--the dreary wastefulness, that is, of such a life in case of such a young man as FrÃ©dÃ©ric Moreau, who with Madame Bovary is Flaubert's contribution to the pathology of _le mal romantique_.	True
FIGURES OF SEVERAL CENTURIES ***	Madame Bovary	Madame Bovary is a little woman, half vulgar and half hysterical, incapable of a fine passion; but her trivial desires, her futile aspirations after second-rate pleasures and second-hand ideals, give to Flaubert all that he wants: the opportunity to create beauty out of reality.	True
SEARCH-LIGHT LETTERS ***	Madame Bovary	Seeing that she had read Madame Bovary and Anna Karénina, was she not amply qualified to detect immorality at first blush?	True
THE CRAFT OF FICTION***	Madame Bovary	In Madame Bovary the scenes are distributed and rendered with very rare skill; not one but seems to have more and more to give with every fresh reading of it.	True
AT LARGE ***	The Pilgrim's Progress	A bunch of keys to play with, and a little later a box of bricks; the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress and Robinson Crusoe to read; a summary whipping if he fell down and hurt himself, or if he ever cried.	True
ROBERT FALCONER ***	The Pilgrim's Progress	Betty had gone to church, and he was alone with his grandmother, reading The Pilgrim's Progress to her, when, just as Christian knocked at the wicket-gate, a tap came to the street door, and he went to open it.	True

A MODERN HISTORY ***	The Pilgrim's Progress	The Pilgrim's Progress is the most popular religious work ever published, full of genius and beauty, and a complete exhibition of the Calvinistic theology, and the experiences of the Christian life.	True
FROM A COLLEGE WINDOW ***	The Pilgrim's Progress	Readers of The Pilgrim's Progress will no doubt remember the young woman whose name was Dull, and her choice of companions--Simple, Sloth, Presumption, Short-mind, Slow-pace, No-heart, Linger-after-lust, and Sleepy-head.	True
THE LIFE OF CHARLES DICKENS ***	Barnaby Rudge	Of what he suffered from these adaptations of his books, multiplied remorselessly at every theatre, I have forborne to speak, but it was the subject of complaint with him incessantly; and more or less satisfied as he was with individual performances, such as Mr. Yates's Quilp or Mantalini and Mrs. Keeley's Smike or Dot, there was only one, that of Barnaby Rudge by the Miss Fortescue who became afterwards Lady Gardner, on which I ever heard him dwell with a thorough liking.	True
IN JAIL WITH CHARLES DICKENS ***	Barnaby Rudge	No words, or even voices, could be distinguished in this clamor, nor did they speak much to each other; though such as were better informed on the topic than the rest would tell their neighbors, perhaps, that they might know the hangman when he came out, by his being the shorter one; and that the man that was to suffer with him was named Hugh; and that it was Barnaby Rudge who would be hanged in Bloomsbury Square.	False
PREFACE TO DOCTOR'S DILEMMA ***	Barnaby Rudge	This is why operating surgeons, who are usually out of the house with their fee in their pockets before the patient has recovered consciousness, and who therefore see nothing of the suffering witnessed by the general practitioner and the nurse, occasionally talk of operations very much as the hangman in Barnaby Rudge talked of executions, as if being operated on were a luxury in sensation as well as in price.	True
BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE, JULY 1845 ***	Barnaby Rudge	The raven of Barnaby Rudge had a hard fight of it to maintain his ground.	False
DICKENS AS AN EDUCATOR***	Barnaby Rudge	From the time of Barnaby Rudge his unconscious recognition of the right of the child to have his imagination made freer and stronger can be felt in his writings.	True
ESSAYS FROM 'THE GUARDIAN' ***	Barnaby Rudge	[7] If the invasion of the legitimate sphere of prose in England by the spirit of poetry, weaker or stronger, has been something far deeper than is indicated by that tendency to write unconscious blank verse, which has made it feasible to transcribe about one-half of Dickens's otherwise so admirable Barnaby Rudge in blank-verse lines, a tendency (outdoing our old friend M. Jourdain) commoner than Mr. Saintsbury admits, such lines being frequent in his favourite Dryden; yet, on the other hand, it might be maintained, and would be maintained by its French critics, that our English poetry has been too apt to dispense with those prose qualities, which, though not the indispensable qualities of poetry, go, nevertheless, to the making of all first-rate poetry--the  qualities, namely, of orderly structure, and such qualities generally as depend upon second thoughts.	True
DOROTHY AT SKYRIE ***	Barnaby Rudge	She had recently been promoted to the reading of Dickens, and enthralled by the adventures of Barnaby Rudge she had wandered far in spirit from that mountain farm and the disgruntled Babcocks.	True
CHARACTER SKETCHES ***	Notre Dame de Paris	At Notre Dame de Paris there were at one time gargoyles used for extinguishing torches, and the smoke added not a little to their ugliness.	False

A WANDERER IN PARIS***	Notre Dame de Paris	There are times of day now, when the sun spatters on the wall, when it might be almost any church; but towards evening in the gloom it is Notre Dame de Paris again, mysterious and a little sinister.	False
A RESIDENCE IN FRANCE ***	Notre Dame de Paris	Notre Dame de Paris is a noble monument, and now that the place of the archbishop is destroyed, one is likely to get better views of it, than is apt to be the case with these venerable edifices.	False
THE CATHEDRALS OF SOUTHERN FRANCE ***	Notre Dame de Paris	This point is mentioned here from the fact that many have claimed a familiarity with the cathedrals of France; when to all practical purposes, they might as well have begun and ended with the observation that Notre Dame de Paris stands on an island in the middle of the Seine.	False
TRILBY ***	Notre Dame de Paris	One gap went right through the block, and gave him a glimpse of the river, the "CitÃ©," and the ominous old Morgue; a little to the right rose the gray towers of Notre Dame de Paris into the checkered April sky.	False
PARIS UNDER THE COMMUNE ***	Notre Dame de Paris	The destruction of the Colonne Vendôme is but a beginning, be logical and continue; I propose a few decrees: "The Commune of Paris, considering that the Church of Notre Dame de Paris is a monument of superstition, a symbol of divine tyranny, an affirmation of fanaticism, a denial of human rights, a permanent insult offered by believers to atheists, a perpetual conspiracy against one of the great principles of the Commune, namely, the convenience of its members, "Decrees: "The Church of Notre Dame shall be demolished."	False
THE DARK STAR ***	Notre Dame de Paris	I ought to be happy, Mr. Neeland, but everything is so new and strange--even Sunday is not restful; and how different is Notre Dame de Paris and Saint Eustache from our church at Gayfield!	False
DANES, SAXONS AND NORMANS ***	Notre Dame de Paris	I will be churched at Notre Dame de Paris with ten thousand lances for my candles."	False
THE CATHEDRAL ***	Notre Dame de Paris	Those of Notre Dame de Paris are thick-set and gloomy, almost elephantine; cleft almost from top to bottom by deep bays, they seem to mount slowly and with difficulty, and stop short, crushed as it were by the burden of sins, dragged down to earth by the wickedness of the city; we feel the effort with which they rise, and we are saddened as we contemplate those captive masses, all the more depressing by reason of the dismal hue of the louvre-boards.	False
CATHEDRALS OF SPAIN***	Notre Dame de Paris	It is the best type of late thirteenth or early fourteenth-century wheel of radial system, very similar in design to the western wheel of Notre Dame de Paris and the great western one of Burgos.	False
CATHEDRAL CITIES OF SPAIN ***	Notre Dame de Paris	The west porch is the finest Gothic specimen of its kind which exists in Spain and recalls those of Notre Dame de Paris and the Cathedral at Chartres.	False
EN ROUTE***	Notre Dame de Paris	Indeed from an artistic point of view, it was the only church which satisfied him, for Notre Dame de Paris was too grand, and too much overrun by tourists; there were few ceremonies there, just the necessary amount of prayers were weighed out, and the greater part of the chapels remained closed; and lastly the voices of the choir boys always wanted mending; they broke, while the advanced age of the basses made them hoarse.	False
A SMALL BOY AND OTHERS ***	Dombey and Son	One of these was Godey's Lady's Book, a sallow pile of which (it shows to me for sallow in the warmer and less stony light of the Wall Street of those days and through the smell of ancient anodynes) lay on Joey Bagstock's table for our beguilement while we waited: I was to encounter in Phiz's Dombey and Son that design for our tormentor's type.	True

Dombey and Son had their offices in the City, within the sound of Bow Bells, and not far from the Mansion House.	False
SUPPERS ***	Dombey and Son	Some of the pathetic scenes from Dombey and Son can be read by some one whose musical voice and gentle face, as well as intelligent reading, make this part especially effective.	True
A MOTHER'S LIST OF BOOKS FOR ***	Alice's Adventures in Wonderland	Alice's Adventures in Wonderland seem nowhere very strange to him, while Chaucer and Spenser need only to be simply told, while Dana's Two Years Before the Mast and Hughes's Tom Brown's School Days at Rugby hold their own as well as Jack and the Bean-Stalk.	True
LEWIS CARROLL IN WONDERLAND ***	Alice's Adventures in Wonderland	Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass' have the rare charm of freshness for children and for their elders, and the many strange personages concerned--the White Rabbit, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the Hatter, the Dormouse, the Gryphon, the Mock Turtle, the Red and White Kings and Queens, the Walrus, Humpty-Dumpty, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and all the rest of them--being seen at home, so to speak, and not on parade as in an ordinary pantomime.	True
THE HISTORY OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE, VOLUME V***	Alice's Adventures in Wonderland	Mrs. Grenfell said of it at this convention: "It is as absurd to refute her assertions as to reply to Baron Munchausen or to insist that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland never happened.	True
SHANDYGAFF***	Bacon's Essays	Then may we prop our Bacon's Essays against the pewter and study those mellow words: "Certainly it is heaven upon earth to have a man's mind move in charity, rest in providence, and turn upon the poles of truth."	True

UNDER FALSE PRETENCES***	Bacon's Essays	"Reach me down that volume of Bacon's Essays behind you; I must have something to take the taste out of my mouth before I begin to write."	True
STUDIES IN LITERATURE ***	Bacon's Essays	Their range extends from prudential kitchen maxims, such as Franklin set forth in the sayings of Poor Richard about thrift in time and money, up to such great and high moralities of life as are the prose maxims of Goethe,--just as Bacon's Essays extend from precepts as to building and planting, up to solemn reflections on truth, death, and the vicissitudes of things.	True

THE GREAT SPEECHES AND ORATIONS OF DANIEL WEBSTER***	Bacon's Essays	It would be no disparagement to an educated man, if it were said that he had never read these speeches; but it would be a serious bar to his claim to be considered an English scholar, if he confessed to be ignorant of the great speeches of Burke; for such a confession would be like admitting that he had never read the first book of Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, Bacon's Essays and Advancement of Learning, Milton's Areopagitica, Butler's Analogy, and Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations.	True
THE VITALIZED SCHOOL***	Pollyanna	In order to lure Pollyanna into his world to imbue it with the spirit of gladness, he must establish a community of interests with her by imbibing her spirit as revealed in the book.	True
THE CHILDREN'S SIX MINUTES ***	Pollyanna	It is a fine thing to read a story like Pollyanna and get all excited over it.	True
LOVE CONQUERS ALL ***	Pollyanna	I suppose that the Pollyanna of the camping party is constantly sending up three smokes in a row on the slightest provocation, and then when the rest of the outfit have raced across country for miles to find out what the good news is she probably shows them, with great enthusiasm, that some fringed gentians are already in blossom or that the flicker's eggs have hatched.

THROUGH NATURE TO GOD ***	War and Peace	In that tale of War and Peace wherein the fervid genius of Tolstoi has depicted scenes and characters of modern life with truthful grandeur like that of the ancient epic poems, when our friend, the genial and thoughtful hero of the story, stands in the public square at Moscow, uncertain of his fate, while the kindly bright-faced peasant and the eager pale young mechanic are shot dead by his side, and all for a silly suspicion on the part of Napoleon's soldiery; as he stands and sees the bodies, still warm and quivering, tossed into a trench and loose earth hastily shovelled over them, his manly heart surges in rebellion against a world in which such things can be, and a voice within him cries out,--not in the mood in which the fool crieth, but with the anguish of a tender soul wrung by the sight of stupendous iniquity,--"There is no God!"

COURT OF GEORGE IV ***	War and Peace	The great object of France, in all her twisted course, has been to have the question of War and Peace left in her hands by the rest of Europe, then by a dexterous application of this power to produce a restoration of some portion of the King of Spain's authority, and on that ground to regain her ancient influence in his Court.	False
TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD ***	War and Peace	As I went down the stairs it seemed to me that in spite of the bitter wrangling, no real voice from the rough world outside could penetrate this high, cold hall, and that the Provisional Government was wreckedâon the same rock of War and Peace that had wrecked the Miliukov Ministryâ¦.

WARFARE OF SCIENCE WITH THEOLOGY ***	War and Peace	Great as Grotius was--and it may well be held that his book on War and Peace has wrought more benefit to humanity than any other attributed to human authorship--he was, in the matter of interest for money, too much entangled in theological reasoning to do justice to his cause or to himself.	True

True
ABROAD AT HOME***	Huckleberry Finn	There were the old outhouses, the old back stair, the old back fence, and the little window looking down on them--the window of Tom Sawyer, beneath which, in the gloaming, Huckleberry Finn made catcalls to summon forth his fellow bucaneer.	True
CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY ***	Huckleberry Finn	One of papa's latest books is "The Prince and the Pauper" and it is unquestionably the best book he has ever written, some people want him to keep to his old style, some gentleman wrote him, "I enjoyed Huckleberry Finn immensely and am glad to see that you have returned to your old style."	True
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO ... ***	Huckleberry Finn	And, knowing it was rather childish, he still enjoyed the small Huckleberry Finn pleasure of playing hooky from the Neurophysical Institute.	True
THE AMERICAN SPIRIT IN LITERATURE, ***	Huckleberry Finn	As a professional humorist, he has paid the obligatory tax for his extravagance, over-emphasis, and undisciplined taste, but such faults are swiftly forgotten when one turns to Huckleberry Finn and the negro Jim and Pudd'nhead Wilson, when one feels Mark Twain's power in sheer description and episode, his magic in evoking landscape and atmosphere, his blazing scorn at injustice and cruelty, his contempt for quacks.	True
TOM SAWYER ***	Huckleberry Finn	Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost, forever and forever.	True
THE MODERN KU KLUX KLAN ***	Huckleberry Finn	We had an awful oath to which we swore, and in imitation of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, sealed it with our blood.	True

MARK TWAIN, A BIOGRAPHY, ***	Huckleberry Finn	I can never forget or be ungrateful for the exquisite pleasure with which I read Huckleberry Finn for the first time years ago.	True
BRITISH BIRDS IN THEIR HAUNTS ***	Anabasis	The earliest mention of it which I find occurs in the Anabasis of Xenophon, who describes a plain or steppe near the Euphrates full of aromatic herbs, and abounding with Wild Asses, Ostriches, and Bustards (_Otis_).	True
PLATO, COMPANIONS OF SOKRATES, VOL I ***	Anabasis	iv. 2; and Bekker alludes justly to the remarkable passage in the Anabasis of Xenophon, about books exported to the Hellenic cities in the Euxine (Anabas.	True
PLATO, COMPANIONS OF SOKRATES, VOL II ***	Anabasis	Plato probably borrowed from the Xenophontic Anabasis the name, country, and social position of Menon, who may have received teaching from Gorgias, as we know that Proxenus did, Xen.	True
LITTLE JOURNEYS TO THE HOMES OF THE GREAT, VOLUME 3 (OF 14)***	Anabasis	At Harvard, he had read the Anabasis on compulsion, but now he read it with zest.	True
THE CORDS OF VANITY ***	Anabasis	Since the Anabasis of lad's love traverses a monotonous country, where one hill is largely like another, and one meadow a duplicate of the next to the last daffodil, I may with profit dwell upon the green-sickness lightly.	True

STORIES OF GREAT MEN ***	Anabasis	Of all his writings, his Anabasis has been pronounced the most remarkable.	True
THE TRIAL OF JESUS ***	Anabasis	The Commentaries of Cæsar and the Anabasis of Xenophon record the mighty deeds and brilliant achievements of their authors; but this fact does not destroy their reliability as historical records in the estimation of those who insist that the Gospel writers shall be rejected on grounds of bias and partiality.	True
SUCCESSFUL NEW HAMPSHIRE MEN ***	Anabasis	Crosby's Greek grammar and his edition of Xenophon's Anabasis soon came into common use, and have been of great service in promoting the elementary instruction of thousands of Greek scholars since; as also have Felton's Reader and his editions of Aristophanes, etc.	True
A DESCRIPTION OF THE BAR-AND-FRAME-HIVE***	Anabasis	It is recorded by Xenophon in his Anabasis that, during the retreat of the ten thousand, the soldiers sucked some honey-combs in a place near Trebizonde, and in consequence became intoxicated, and did not recover their strength for three or four days; and these effects are supposed to have been produced from the honey having been extracted by the bees from the rhododendron ponticum or azalea pontica of Linnaeus.	True
MENO ***	Anabasis	The repulsive picture which is given of him in the Anabasis of Xenophon, where he also appears as the friend of Aristippus 'and a fair youth having lovers,' has no other trait of likeness to the Meno of Plato.	True
THE UNSEEN WORLD AND OTHER ESSAYS ***	Anabasis	Readers of Xenophon's Anabasis will remember the frequency of the speeches in that charming book.	True
POSTHUMOUS WORKS OF DE QUINCEY ***	Anabasis	The word Anabasis must have its accent on the syllable _ab_, not on the penultimate syllable _as_.	False
A MANUAL OF ANCIENT HISTORY***	Anabasis	To this period of history belong, not only his Anabasis and Hellenica, but also his Cyropædia, or portraiture of a happy empire and an accomplished ruler, according to eastern ideas, exhibited in the example of Cyrus: of use so far as pure historic records are interwoven with the narrative.	True
DIKES AND DITCHES ***	Anabasis	Leopold, "Roi de Belge," would probably inform him that he had, either directly or through his faithful minister, heard of the distinguished Greek _savant_; that he had seen or heard of the Greek Grammar he had published, the Greek Reader he had compiled, and the Anabasis he had edited and annotated.	True
THE ESSAYS OF "GEORGE ELIOT"***	Anabasis	 If Dr. Cumming had chosen Plato's Epistles or Anacreon's Poems instead of the Anabasis or the Ars Poetica, he would have reduced the extent of the falsehood, and would have furnished a ready reply which would have been equally effective with his Sunday-school teachers and their disputants.	True
CHARLES EDWARD PUTNEY ***	Anabasis	To him, consequently, the Anabasis and Homer were more real than otherwise they might have seemed--though Mr. Putney had the gift of making those old stories real.	True
ATLANTIC CLASSICS ***	Anabasis	I had my wish; and as my obedient band followed me, I fear my complacent back and Anabasis manner expressed some sentiment like this: 'Only observe how it pays to see France with a person who knows the ropes!'	True

True
DICKENS' STORIES ABOUT CHILDREN EVERY CHILD CAN READ***	Little Dorrit	But Little Dorrit never forgot, as, sad to say, the rest of the family did, the friends who had been kind to them in their poverty; and when, in his turn, Mr. Clennam became a prisoner in the Marshalsea, Little Dorrit came to comfort and console him, and after many changes of fortune she became his wife, and they lived happy ever after.

WORLD'S BEST LITERATURE - VOLUME 11 ***	Little Dorrit	Little Dorrit herself was "the child of the Marshalsea," in which she was born and brought up; and the whole story is an appeal against the injustice of depriving of personal liberty those who cannot pay their bills, or meet their notes, however small.	True
ENGLAND OF MY HEART--SPRING ***	Little Dorrit	It is still of Dickens most of us will think in passing St George's Church, for was it not there that Little Dorrit was christened and married, and was it not in the vestry there she slept with the burial- book for a pillow?	True

DICKENS ***	Little Dorrit	Even Little Dorrit herself had, we are told, one stain from her prison experience; and it is spoken of like a bodily stain; like something that cannot be washed away.	True
THE CRAFT OF FICTION***	Little Dorrit	Beginning with a deceptive air of intending mainly a novel of manners and humours, as Stevenson once pointed out, in Bleak House or in Little Dorrit or in Our Mutual Friend--in his later books generally--he insinuates a thread of action that gradually twists more and more of the matter of the book round itself.	True

BEECHCROFT AT ROCKSTONE ***	Silas Marner	It was only the remembrance of her mother's positive orders that withheld Gillian from the declaration that mamma always let them read George Eliot; and in a cooler moment of reflection she was glad she had abstained, for she recollected that _always_ was limited to mamma's having read most of Romola aloud to her and Mysie, and to her having had Silas Marner to read when she was unwell in lodgings, and there was a scarcity of books.

WOMEN NOVELISTS ***	Silas Marner	The state of isolation in which Silas Marner lived was true on all these counts--his being a "foreigner" to the autochthonous shepherds and farmers of Ravaloe--his half mazed, half broken-hearted state owing to the false accusation brought against him and the criminal neglect of Providence to show his innocence--and his strange and uncongenial trade.	True

ENTIRE PG WARNER ***	Ramona	I do not mean to say that the people in California knew personally Ramona and Alessandro, or altogether believe in them, but that in their idealizations they recognize a verity and the ultimate truth of human nature, while in the scenery, in the fading sentiment of the old Spanish life, and the romance and faith of the Missions, the author has done for the region very much what Scott did for the Highlands.

CHARMIDES ***	Phaedo	To quote Dr. Jackson's own expressions,--'whereas in the period of the Republic and the Phaedo, it was proposed to pass through ontology to the sciences, in the period of the Parmenides and the Philebus, it is proposed to pass through the sciences to ontology': or, as he repeats in nearly the same words,--'whereas in the Republic and in the Phaedo he had dreamt of passing through ontology to the sciences, he is now content to pass through the sciences to ontology.'

WHAT DREAMS MAY COME ***	Phaedo	She has been brought up in such seclusion--and under the sole tuition of a man not only a pedant, but who has never stepped through the gates of the last generation--that she reminds one of those fair English dames who used to prowl about their parks with the Phaedo under their arm and long for a block on which to float down to prosperity; Plato had quite enough to do to sail for himself.

BEACON LIGHTS OF HISTORY, VOLUME I***	Phaedo	Among these were Aristippus, Antisthenes, Euclid of Megara, Phaedo of Elis, and Plato, all of whom were pupils of Socrates and founders of schools.	False

COURT OF QUEEN ELIZABETH ***	Phaedo	Lady Jane was alone at his arrival, the rest of the family being on a hunting party; and gaining admission to her apartment, he found her reading by herself the Phaedo of Plato in the original, which she understood so perfectly as to excite in him extreme wonder; for she was at this time under fifteen years of age.	True
CHRISTIANITY AND GREEK PHILOSOPHY ***	Phaedo	The Phaedo presents the doctrine and the _reasoning_ by which Socrates had elevated his mind above the fear of death.	True
THREE FRENCH MORALISTS ***	Phaedo	But I am not sure whether, in order to live happily and as a man of the highest sense of honour, it is not better to be Alcibiades and Phaedo than to be Aristides and Socrates.	False
FIVE YEARS OF THEOSOPHY***	Phaedo	 Certainly in the Phaedo the dialogue popularly supposed to contain all Plato's teaching on the subject--the immortality allotted to the impure soul is of a very questionable character, and we should rather infer from the account there given that the human personality, at all events, is lost by successive immersions into "matter."	True
PHILEBUS ***	Phaedo	But in the Phaedo the Socratic has already passed into a more ideal point of view; and he, or rather Plato speaking in his person, expressly repudiates the notion that the exchange of a less pleasure for a greater can be an exchange of virtue.	True
THE STORY OF WELLESLEY ***	Phaedo	Miss Montague used to have a little class in Plato, and I have not forgotten how quietly we read together one day at the end of the Phaedo of the death of Socrates.	True
ROMAN SOCIETY FROM NERO TO MARCUS AURELIUS***	Phaedo	The Phaedo was the last consolation of many a victim of conscription or imperial tyranny.	True
SCIENCE AND MEDIEVAL THOUGHT***	Phaedo	[6] I see in recent reports of Egyptian exploration that at Oxyrhynchus Plato was represented with curious persistence by the Phaedo and the Laches; and these treatises appear in the early Fayyum papyri.	True

NATURE MYSTICISM ***	Phaedo	The subterranean waters figured also in the Greek mysteries, and are elaborated with much detail in Plato's great Phaedo Myth--in all these cases with increasing fullness of mystical meaning.	True
THE INHUMANITY OF SOCIALISM ***	Phaedo	I am so sure of this, in fact, that I am going to make that assumption, in which we all agree, the starting point of a little dialogue, in which, after the manner of Plato, I will put Socrates at one end of the discussion, and some of his friends, whom we will suppose to be Phaedo, and Crito, and Simmias, and the rest at the other, and we will let Socrates and Phaedo carry on the conversation, which might run as follows: SOCRATES--We are agreed, then, that no man has any right inherent in himself to the ownership of land.	False
ROMAN LIFE IN THE DAYS OF CICERO ***	Phaedo	He then read the Phaedo again from beginning to end, and afterwards fell into so profound a sleep that persons standing outside the chamber heard his breathing.	True
LAWS ***	Phaedo	The prospect of the existence of the soul after death is constantly present to them; though they can hardly be said to have the cheerful hope and resignation which animates Socrates in the Phaedo or Cephalus in the Republic.	True
INTRODUCTION TO THE ***	Phaedo	"But if it be requisite to lay before the reader those dialogues out of many which principally unfold to us the mystic discipline about the gods, I shall not err in ranking among this number the Phaedo and Phaedrus, the Banquet and the Philebus, and together with these the Sophista and Politicus, the Cratylus and the Timaeus.	True
WORLD'S BEST LITERATURE ***	Phaedo	I found her in her chamber, reading Phaedo Platonis in Greek, and that with as much delight as some gentlemen would read a merry tale in Boccace.	True
PROTAGORAS ***	Phaedo	Had Protagoras been allowed by Plato to make the Aristotelian distinction, and say that virtue is not knowledge, but is accompanied with knowledge; or to point out with Aristotle that the same quality may have more than one opposite; or with Plato himself in the Phaedo to deny that good is a mere exchange of a greater pleasure for a less--the unity of virtue and the identity of virtue and knowledge would have required to be proved by other arguments.	True
LORE OF PROSERPINE ***	Phaedo	I reasoned like Socrates and made Phaedo weep; I persuaded like Saint Paul and saw the throng on Mars' Hill sway to my words.	True
PHAEDO ***	Phaedo	The perplexity should not be forgotten by us when we attempt to submit the Phaedo of Plato to the requirements of logic.	True
APOLOGY, CRITO, AND PHAEDO ***	Phaedo	"Nor, again, is Simmias exceeded by Phaedo, because Phaedo is Phaedo, but because Phaedo possesses magnitude in comparison with Simmias's littleness?"	True
CHURCH AND STATE AS SEEN IN THE FORMATION OF CHRISTENDOM***	Phaedo	Heathen philosophy could boast of two converts, Phaedo and Polemo; on which he says, "We assert that the whole habitable world contains evidence of the works of Jesus, in the existence of those churches of God which have been founded through Him by those who have been converted from the practice of innumerable sins.	False
THE ESSAYS OF MONTAIGNE, VOLUME 15 ***	Phaedo	 Phaedo the philosopher, a man of birth, after the taking of his country Elis, made it his trade to prostitute the beauty of his youth, so long as it lasted, to any one that would, for money thereby to gain his living: and Solon was the first in Greece, 'tis said, who by his laws gave liberty to women, at the expense of their chastity, to provide for the necessities of life; a custom that Herodotus says had been received in many governments before his time.	False
THE BOYS' AND GIRLS' PLUTARCH ***	Phaedo	And after the Median war, Phaedo being archon of Athens, the Athenians, consulting the oracle at Delphi, were commanded to gather together the bones of Theseus, and, laying them in some honorable place, keep them as sacred in the city.	False
AN AMERICAN AT OXFORD ***	Phaedo	Those who are not "European British subjects" may substitute certain sacred works in Sanskrit, Arabic, or Pali; and those who object for conscientious scruples to a study of the Bible may substitute the Phaedo of Plato; but the sagacious undergraduate knows that if he does this he must have no conscientious scruples against harder work.	True
THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY, VOL. ***	Phaedo	He had gone to Brodegate, to take leave of her, and "found her in her chamber alone, reading Phaedo Platonis in Greek, and that with as much delight as some gentlemen would read a merry tale of Boccace"; and as all the rest of the Greys were hunting in the park, the schoolmaster inquired why she should lose such pastime.

True
CATO MAIOR DE SENECTUTE ***	Phaedo	the passage is from Plato, Phaedo 61 A-62 C. Plato makes Socrates there profess to quote Philolaus, the Pythagorean; Cic.	True
MENO ***	Phaedo	But in the Phaedo the doctrine of ideas is subordinate to the proof of the immortality of the soul.	True
SYMPOSIUM ***	Phaedo	The Phaedo also presents some points of comparison with the Symposium.	True
TERRESTRIAL & CELESTIAL GLOBES V.2/2 ***	Phaedo	Plato's statement in Phaedo merely observes that the earth, if like a ball, must be suspended without support in the interior of a hollow sphere.	True
CALLIAS ***	Phaedo	He has written to invite us, not because he can himself see us, for he is not sufficiently recovered from his late illness, but because we shall thus be able to talk with his friend Phaedo; for as all know there is no more fitting person than Phaedo to tell our young friend Callias the things that he desires to hear.	False
ELEMENTS OF MORALS ***	Phaedo	[159] Plato in the Phaedo (trad. de Saisset, p. 31) seems to condemn the idea of combating passion by passion: "To exchange one sensual pleasure for another," he says, "one grief for another, one fear for another, and to do like those who get small change for a piece of money, is not the path which leads to virtue.	True
CHRISTIANITY AS A MYSTICAL FACT ***	Phaedo	Phaedo says this in the _Dialogue on the Immortality of the Soul_: "Truly I found myself in the strangest state of mind.	True
THE FORMATION OF CHRISTENDOM, VOLUME II***	Phaedo	Three of his finest dialogues are dedicated to setting forth as many aspects of his doctrine as to the soul's immortality; the Phaedrus treats of its preexistence; the Banquet of the influence of immortality on the relations of the present life; the Phaedo of death as the means of a happy futurity.(368)	True

BLACKWOOD'S EDINBURGH ***	Gulliver's Travels	And, if we insist upon it, that a reform by the pen, or even by speech-making, is better than one by pike and musket--if we should suggest that matters of civil government are better decided by civil and political reasoning than by metaphorical texts of Scripture, interpreted by prejudice and passion--if we contend for such truisms as these, shall we not be in danger of occupying some such position as the worthy prelate whose sagacity led him to discover that _some facts_ in Gulliver's Travels had surely been overcharged?	True
LECTURES ON THE ENGLISH POETS***	Gulliver's Travels	Dr. Johnson could not deny that Gulliver's Travels were his; he therefore disputed their merits, and said that after the first idea of them was conceived, they were easy to execute; all the rest followed mechanically.	True

HOMES, HAUNTS OF EMINENT BRITISH POETS ***	Gulliver's Travels	We want to see where the author of the Drapier's Letters and of Gulliver's Travels lived; where he conversed with Stella and Mrs. Whiteway, and joked with Sheridan and Delany, and where he finally sank into moody melancholy, and died.	True
BERT LLOYD'S BOYHOOD ***	Gulliver's Travels	As for his bearing toward Bert, it showed such affection, obedience, and intelligence, that it is not to be wondered at, if the boy sometimes asked himself if the "Houyhnhnms" of Gulliver's Travels had not their counterpart in nature, after all.	True
WEBSTER'S UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY ***	Gulliver's Travels	LAPUTAN La*pu"tan, a. Defn: Of or pertaining to Laputa, an imaginary flying island described in Gulliver's Travels as the home of chimerical philosophers.	True
THE GOLDEN CENSER ***	Gulliver's Travels	And yet, in spite of Slow and Sleepyhead, wonders have accumulated upon wonders, until the Arabian Nights and Gulliver's Travels are only the creations of a poor fancy, while the intimations which the future affords us stagger the understanding and make us almost idolatrous in our admiration of the quiet, keen-acting men who have dared out into fairy-land and returned laden like the spies coming from Canaan.

INQUIRIES AND OPINIONS ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	The Goncourts perceived this descent of Poe from Voltaire when they recorded in their 'Journal' that the strange tales of the American poet seemed to them to belong to "a new literature, the literature of the twentieth century, scientifically miraculous story-telling by A + B, a literature at once monomaniac and mathematical, Zadig as district-attorney, Cyrano de Bergerac as a pupil of Arago."	True
THE PG ENCYCLOPEDIA, VOL 1 ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	The same notion is utilized by Cyrano de Bergerac (1619-1655) in his romances describing journeys to the moon and sun, for his French traveller fastens round his body a multitude of very thin flasks filled with the morning's dew, whereby through the attractive power of the sun's heat on the dew he is raised to the middle regions of the atmosphere, to sink again, however, on the breaking of some of the flasks.	False
MARSE HENRY, COMPLETE ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	Nor yet quite all on murder bent, some on pleasure; the Knights and Ladies of the Cloth of Gold and the hosts of the Renaissance: Cyrano de Bergerac and François Villon leading the ragamuffin procession; the jades of the Fronde, Longueville, Chevreuse and fair-haired Anne of Austria; and Ninon, too, and Manon; and the never-to-be-forgotten Four, 'one for all and all for one;' Cagliostro and Monte Cristo; on the side, Rabelais taking notes and laughing under his cowl.	False
THE ROWLEY POEMS ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	We hear also of Michael Clayfield, a distiller, one of the very few men in Bristol whom Chatterton admired and respected; of Baker, the poet's bedfellow at Colston's, for whom Chatterton wrote love poems, as Cyrano de Bergerac did for Christian de Neuvillette, to the address of a certain Miss Hoyland--thin, conventional silly stuff, but Roxane was probably not very critical; of Catcott's brother, the Rev. A. Catcott, who had a fine library and was the author of a treatise on the Deluge; of Smith, a schoolfellow; of Palmer an engraver, and a number of others--mere names for the most part.	False
THE ENGLISH NOVEL ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	Rabelais had made a better use of it before Sidney, and after him, without mentioning Shakespeare, Cyrano de Bergerac furnished more laughable specimens.	False
TRIPS TO THE MOON***	Cyrano de Bergerac	The endeavour of small Greek historians to add interest to their work by magnifying the exploits of their countrymen, and piling wonder upon wonder, Lucian first condemned in his "Instructions for Writing History," and then caricatured in his "True History," wherein is contained the account of a trip to the moon, a piece which must have been enjoyed by Rabelais, which suggested to Cyrano de Bergerac his Voyages to the Moon and to the Sun, and insensibly contributed, perhaps, directly or through Bergerac, to the conception of "Gulliver's Travels."	False
OUR STAGE AND ITS CRITICS ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	Probably the built-up nose of Coquelin as Cyrano de Bergerac will be thrown in my face; it must, however, be remembered, that apart from his large elastic mouth Coquelin's face was rather wooden, and he relied for expression chiefly on voice, mouth, gesture and movement.	True
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	Everyone will remember the effective appearance of Cyrano de Bergerac in the first act of the fine play of that name; when instead of leaping in by any hackneyed door or window, he suddenly springs upon a chair above the crowd that has so far kept him invisible; "les bras croisés, le feutre en bataille, la moustache hérissée, le nez terrible."	True
MOTHER EARTH, APRIL 1906 ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	(Did not the fate of Cyrano de Bergerac lie in his gigantic nose?)	True
MATERIALS AND METHODS OF FICTION ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	M. Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac is not merely Cyrano, but also M. Constant Coquelin; M. Sardou's La Tosca is not merely La Tosca, but also Mme.	True
A HERO AND SOME OTHER FOLKS***	Cyrano de Bergerac	 Even Cyrano de Bergerac is so out of keeping with the new notion of the heroic, that the translator of the drama must apologize for his hero's swagger.	True
THE GREAT WHITE TRIBE IN FILIPINIA ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	It was somewhat of a Cyrano de Bergerac affair; one of the principals, concealed behind the "leading man," using his own arms for gestures, sang his representative love for the señorita in the Spanish dancer's costume.	True
ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	This is Cyrano de Bergerac (1619-1655), who, besides composing doubtful comedies and tragedies, writing political pamphlets, and exercising the task of literary criticism in objecting to Scarron's burlesques, produced in his _Histoires comiques des états et empires de la lune et du soleil_, half romantic and half satirical compositions, in which some have seen the original of _Gulliver's Travels_, in which others have discovered only a not very successful imitation of Rabelais, and which, without attempting to decide these questions, may fairly be ranked in the same class of fiction with the masterpieces of Swift and Rabelais, though of course at an immense distance below them.	False
SHORT HISTORY OF FRENCH LITERATURE ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	Cyrano de Bergerac was a Gascon of not inconsiderable literary power, whose odd personal appearance, audacity as a duellist, and adherence, after conversion, to the unpopular cause of Mazarin, gave him a position which his works fail to sustain.	False

LITERARY CHARACTER OF MEN OF GENIUS***	Cyrano de Bergerac	Swift is much indebted for the plans of his two very original performances: he owes the "Travels of Gulliver" to the "Voyages of Cyrano de Bergerac to the Sun and Moon;" a writer, who, without the acuteness of Swift, has wilder flashes of fancy; Joseph Warton has observed many of Swift's strokes in Bishop Godwin's "Man in the Moon," who, in his turn, must have borrowed his work from Cyrano.	False
THE STORY OF ROUEN***	Cyrano de Bergerac	Even if the language and ideas of Corneille's plays do not touch a sympathetic chord in these days when the musketeers of Dumas and the bravery of Cyrano de Bergerac hold the stage on both sides of the Channel, it is impossible to refuse to Corneille a very high position in any estimate of French dramatic literature.	True
BOHEMIANS OF THE LATIN QUARTER***	Cyrano de Bergerac	All the eclecticisms of style are met with in this unheard of idiom, in which apocalyptic phrases jostle cock and bull stories, in which the rusticity of a popular saying is wedded to extravagant periods from the same mold in which Cyrano de Bergerac cast his tirades; in which the paradox, that spoilt child of modern literature, treats reason as the pantaloon is treated in a pantomime; in which irony has the intensity of the strongest acids and the skill of those marksmen who can hit the bull's-eye blindfold; a slang intelligent, though unintelligible to those who have not its key, and the audacity of which surpasses that of the freest tongues.	False
A WOMAN'S BURDEN ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	"Captain Satan" forms a _romance d'aventure_ of the Dumasesque school, having the famous Cyrano de Bergerac for hero, and giving a vivid picture of the redoubtable hero, swashbuckler, poet, and philosopher.	True
THE THEORY OF THE THEATRE ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	The extraordinary nose of Cyrano de Bergerac is described at length by Ragueneau before the hero comes upon the stage.	True
THE VICTORIAN AGE IN LITERATURE ***	Cyrano de Bergerac	Cyrano de Bergerac or Baron Munchausen, or other typical men of science, had treated the moon as a mere flat silver mirror in which Man saw his own image--the Man in the Moon.	True
ENGLISH CARICATURISTS ***	Nicholas Nickleby	Charles Chesterfield becomes Nicholas Nickleby, and Nicholas Nickleby Harry Lorrequer; and with the slightest possible rearrangement, the scenes in which these gentlemen figure from time to time are so much alike, that we are reminded for all the world of the set scenes and artificial backgrounds of a photographer's, "studio."	True
NANCY OF PARADISE COTTAGE ***	Nicholas Nickleby	She had a vague idea that the only possible place would be some pawn-shop, and she had read in Nicholas Nickleby that one can tell a pawn-shop by three golden balls hanging in front of it, and also that one would be likely to find it only in a squalid section of the business district.	True
SKETCHES OF REFORMS AND REFORMERS ***	Nicholas Nickleby	His Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist have done more to drown in ridicule and smother in abhorrence the absurd private schools and the diabolical parish work-houses of England, than the "works" of all the didactic authors of the kingdom.	True
PICKWICKIAN STUDIES***	Nicholas Nickleby	The description of the outlaw drama which Nicholas Nickleby saw on the night of his arrival is exactly in the key of the account of the performance of "Richard III." just given: also the account of the London manager, who was in the boxes; still more so when Mr. Crummles and all the company _died at him_.	True
THE VALET'S TRAGEDY  ***	Nicholas Nickleby	That was the work of a 'Johannes Factotum,' of a 'Shakescene,' as Greene says, of a man who occupied the same position in his theatrical company as Nicholas Nickleby did in that of Mr. Crummles.	True

CHARLES DICKENS AND MUSIC ***	Nicholas Nickleby	We also find references to other crusty individuals who flatly refuse to exercise their talents, as, for instance, after the accident to the coach which was conveying Nicholas Nickleby and Squeers to Yorkshire.	True
ENGLISH LITERATURE, ***	Nicholas Nickleby	The people read with wonder and applause; these haunts of cruelty were scrutinized, some of them were suppressed; and since Nicholas Nickleby appeared no such school can live, because Squeers and Smike are on every lip, and punishment awaits the tyrant.	True
A SMALL BOY AND OTHERS ***	Nicholas Nickleby	The second definite matter in the Dickens connection is the Smike of Miss Weston--whose prænomen I frivolously forget (though I fear it was Lizzie,) but who was afterwards Mrs. E. L. Davenport and then, sequently to some public strife or chatter, Mrs. Charles Matthews--in a version of Nicholas Nickleby that gracelessly managed to be all tearful melodrama, long-lost foundlings, wicked Ralph Nicklebys and scowling Arthur Grides, with other baffled villains, and scarcely at all Crummleses and Kenwigses, much less Squeerses; though there must have been something of Dotheboys Hall for the proper tragedy of Smike and for the broad Yorkshire effect, a precious theatrical value, of John Brodie.	True
MCGUFFEY'S FIFTH ECLECTIC READER ***	Nicholas Nickleby	Nicholas Nickleby is a well-educated, refined young man, who has just obtained the position of assistant teacher, not knowing Squeers's true character.	True
KENTUCKY IN AMERICAN ***	Nicholas Nickleby	One may doubt which holds him closest, the London of History or the London of Fiction, or that London which is a mingling of both, and may be called simply the London of Literature, in which Oliver Goldsmith carouses with Tom Jones, and Harry Fielding discusses philosophy with the Vicar of Wakefield, where Nicholas Nickleby makes so bold as to present himself to Mr. William Makepeace Thackeray and to ask his intercession in favor of a poor artist, the son of a hairdresser of the name of Turner in Maiden Lane, and even where "Boz," as he passes through Longacre, is tripped up by the Artful Dodger, and would perchance fall upon the siding if not caught in the friendly arms of Sir Richard Steele on his way to pay a call upon the once famous beauty, the Lady Beatrix Esmond.	True
TEN GIRLS FROM DICKENS***	Nicholas Nickleby	The young man, Nicholas Nickleby by name, who had rescued the baby, made such an impression upon Mrs. Kenwigs that she felt impelled to propose through the friend whom he had been visiting, that he should instruct the four little Kenwigses in the French language at the weekly stipend of five shillings; being at the rate of one shilling per week, per each Miss Kenwigs, and one shilling over until such time as the baby might be able to take it out in grammar.	False
THE LIFE OF CHARLES DICKENS ***	Nicholas Nickleby	The first number dispersed this cloud of a question in a burst of sunshine; and as much of the gayety of nations as had been eclipsed by old Mr. Pickwick's voluntary exile to Dulwich was restored by the cheerful confidence with which young Mr. Nicholas Nickleby stepped into his shoes.	True
ATLANTIC MONTHLY, APRIL 1860 ***	Nicholas Nickleby	When Nicholas Nickleby acted at Mr. Crummles's theatre, a thrill of terror ran through the unsophisticated spectators, as the wicked relation poked a sword at him in the dark in every direction except where his legs were plainly visible.	True

OXFORD LECTURES ON POETRY ***	Treasure Island	The island of his boyish dreams--if he heard much of voyages as a boy--was, I fancy, the haunt of marmosets and hedgehogs, quaint moon-calves and flitting sprites, lovely colours, sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not, less like Treasure Island than the Coral Island of Ballantyne in the original illustrations, and more full of wonders than of dangers.

ENTIRE PG WARNER ***	Plutarch's Lives	A biography may contain all the facts in regard to a man and his character, arranged in an orderly and comprehensible manner, and yet not be literature; but it may be so written, like Plutarch's Lives or Defoe's account of Robinson Crusoe, that it is literature, and of imperishable value as a picture of human life, as a satisfaction to the want of the human mind which is higher than the want of knowledge.

STORIES FROM THE ITALIAN POETS ***	Decameron	Boccaccio and other novelists are the chief relaters; and their accounts will be received accordingly with the greater or less trust, as the reader considers them probable; but the author of the Decameron personally knew some of his friends and relations, and he intermingles his least favourable reports with expressions of undoubted reverence.

INQUIRIES AND OPINIONS ***	Tom Sawyer	The 'Prince and the Pauper' has the essence of boyhood in it; it has variety and vigor; it has abundant humor and plentiful pathos; and yet I for one would give the whole of it for the single chapter in which Tom Sawyer lets the contract for white-washing his aunt's fence.

ABROAD AT HOME***	Tom Sawyer	But, after all, the club must remember that, in its creditable effort to build up a newer and finer Hannibal, a Hannibal of brick and granite, it is running counter to the sentimental interests of innumerable persons who, though most of them have never seen the old town and never will, yet think of it as given to them by Mark Twain, with a peculiar tenderness, as though it were a Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn among the cities--a ragged, happy boy of a town, which ought never, never to grow up.

True

HUCKLEBERRY FINN, PART 7. ***	Tom Sawyer	Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd GOT to be a slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was.	False
HUCKLEBERRY FINN, PART 8. ***	Tom Sawyer	It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in HER calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people.	True
TOM SAWYER, PART 1. ***	Tom Sawyer	Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an individual--he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.	True

ETIQUETTE ***	Alice in Wonderland	Mental effort is one thing that the younger generation of the "smart world" seems to consider it unreasonable to ask--and just as it is the fashion to let their spines droop until they suggest nothing so much as Tenniel's drawing in Alice in Wonderland of the caterpillar sitting on the toad-stool--so do they let their mental faculties relax, slump and atrophy.	True
GERMANY AND THE GERMANS ***	Alice in Wonderland	That a political boss in this or in that district, should dictate who should and who should not, be employed in the street-cleaning department, even down to the meanest remover of dung with a dust-pan, as was done for years in New York and every other city in America, would be looked upon here as a farce of Topsy-Turvydom, with Alice in Wonderland in the title-rôle.

AMERICANS AND OTHERS ***	Frankenstein	Frankenstein was a large rather than an isolated example.	False
THE SOCIAL CANCER ***	Frankenstein	It was a case of sixteenth-century colonial methods fallen into fretful and frantic senility, so in all this wretched business it is doubtful whim to pity the more: the blind stupidity of the fossilized conservatives incontinently throwing an empire away, forfeiting their influence over a people whom they, by temperament and experience, should have been fitted to control and govern; or the potential cruelty of perverted human nature in the dark Frankenstein who would wreak upon the rulers in their decadent days the most hideous of the methods in the system that produced him, as he planned his festive holocaust and carmagnole on the spot where every spark of initiative and leadership among his people, both good and bad, had been summarily and ruthlessly extinguished.
